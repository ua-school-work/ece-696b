# Advanced Object-Oriented Development

## Assignment 1: KWIC Design Patterns
The `kwic-assignment` directory contains four different architectural implementations of the Key Word in Context (KWIC) system.

For detailed instructions on how to build and run each of the KWIC projects, please see the [KWIC Assignment README](01-kwic-assignment/README.md).

## Assignment 2: Refactoring SearchingCore
The `refactoring-searching-core` directory contains a refactored version of the SearchingCore project, which is a part
of the Searching Challenge. The refactoring focuses on improving the design and structure of the codebase while maintaining
its functionality.

To learn more about the project, please see the [search-challenge README](02-refactoring-searching-core/search-challenge/README.md). `search-challenge`

## Assignment 3: Creational Patterns - Singleton

This project demonstrates the Singleton design pattern, which ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a
lobal point of access to it. For more details on running the project and the tests,
please see the [Singleton README](03-creational-patterns/singleton/README.md).

---
## Assignment 5: Structural Patterns - Adapter

This project demonstrates the Adapter design pattern, which allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
For more details on running the project and the tests, please see the [Adapter README](04-structural-patterns/adapter/README.md).

---
## Assignment 6: Structural Patterns - Bridge

This project demonstrates the Bridge design pattern, which is meant to decouple an abstraction from its implementation
so that the two can vary independently. For more details on running the project and the tests,
please see the [Bridge README](04-structural-patterns/bridge/README.md).
