# Baylor Sports Followers - Minimal Java SE HTTP App

A self-contained HTTP application written in plain Java (no Spring/EE) that demonstrates a 3-layer architecture and a tiny HTML template interpreter. It provides a CRUD UI to collect people who want to follow Baylor sports updates: [name, email, age].

- Server: com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer (Java SE)
- Templating: Minimal engine that resolves controller variables/methods in HTML using `{{variable}}` or `{{method()}}` syntax (no loops/conditions in template; complex fragments are generated in controller methods).
- Layers: Controller → Service (in-memory DAO) → Domain
- Scope: In-memory, application-scope storage (no DB, no sessions/offline storage)

## Requirements implemented
- Start server on port 8089
- Visit http://localhost:8089 to see the HTML form and table
- Create (Add), Read (list), Update (Edit), Delete entries
- Simple server and templating engine written in this project

## Quick start

Prerequisites:
- Java 21+
- Maven 3.9+

Build the JAR:

```bash
mvn -q clean package
```

Run the server:

```bash
java -jar target/enterprise-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Open your browser:

- URL: http://localhost:8089

You should see:
- A form to add or update a person (name, email, optional age)
- A table listing the current people (pre-seeded with a couple of entries)
- Edit/Delete action links per row

## How to use in the browser
- Add: Fill in the form (name, email, optional age) and click the button to save.
- Edit: Click “Edit” to pre-fill the form, then submit to update.
- Delete: Click “Delete” and confirm. (For simplicity, the app uses a GET for delete.)
- Validation: Name and email are required; age must be a number if provided.

## Architecture overview

- App (main): boots HttpServer on port 8089 (set in Main.java via `withPort`), wires controller, service, and template engine, and registers handlers.
- PersonController: Exposes methods/fields used by the template and encapsulates UI state (status messages, current item being edited). Delegates to service.
- PersonService: Application-scope in-memory DAO/service. Thread-safe via synchronized methods.
- TemplateEngine: Resolves `{{token}}` tokens by invoking controller methods or getters using reflection (no loops/conditions). Complex HTML fragments like table rows are generated by controller methods.
- index.html: Static HTML with template tokens that the engine replaces with controller-provided dynamic content.

This keeps responsibilities separated (Single Responsibility, Separation of Concerns) and follows a simple MVC-like layering. It uses composition and encapsulation to comply with SOLID and Clean Code principles. The templating uses a small Reflection-based Interpreter/Template Method style.

## Notes on constraints
- No external frameworks are used (only Java SE). JUnit is included for potential tests but not required.
- No persistence beyond application lifetime. Data is reset on restart.

## Testing
- Run unit tests: `mvn -q test`
- Coverage highlights: DI container wiring (SimpleDiContainerTest), app boot/build (AppBuilderBuildTest), URL query parsing (UrlQueryStringParserTest), and template binding (HtmlMethodBindingTemplateRendererTest).

## Troubleshooting
- Port already in use: Stop other services on 8089 or change the port in Main.java by updating `.withPort(...)` (or adjust the default in AppBuilder).
- Build issues: Ensure your JAVA_HOME points to Java 21+ and Maven is up to date.
